# measure-wasted-renders

**to install**

```bash
npm install --save-dev measure-wasted-renders
```

**to use**

```js
// in your app's entry-point
import React from "react";
import measureWastedRenders from "measure-wasted-renders";

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  measureWastedRenders(React);
}
```

Then later inside the devtools console you can run `window.prettyPrintWasted()` which outputs a table describing all of the components that have rerendered based on shallow changes to its props that were actually deeply equal to previous props.

- Run your app and select "Debug JS Remotely" in the simulator.
- Select "debuggerWorker.js" in the Chrome console.
- In the console, run `window.prettyPrintWasted()`
